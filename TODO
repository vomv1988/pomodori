	_ Test trigger for creating composite key autoincrement (see notes)
	_ Implement trigger system by using autoincrement user_id colum
	_ Propagate user_id in composite keys along tables 'projects' and 'deptree'
		The projects for a single user should share the same user_id
		The tasks for a project should share the same proj_id
		proj_id and task_id should behave in accordance to composite key trigger
	_ Write project/tasks/subtasks display in nasted tables (see notes)

	_ Rewrite task_ctrl.php to display tree using nested model
	_ When a task is clicked, write task_ctrl to display "add subtask" field on top (just like with proj_ctrl)
