	_ Links for projects list in control panel
	_ Project task editor (second order control panel page)
	_ Tree structure for deptree (project tasks)

	_ Test trigger for creating composite key autoincrement (see notes)
	_ Implement trigger system by using autoincrement user_id colum
	_ Propagate user_id in composite keys along tables 'projects' and 'deptree'
		The projects for a single user should share the same user_id
		The tasks for a project should share the same proj_id
		proj_id and task_id should behave in accordance to composite key trigger
	_ Write project/tasks/subtasks display in nasted tables (see notes)

	_ Rewrite task_ctrl.php to display tree using nested model
	_ When a task is clicked, write task_ctrl to display "add subtask" field on top (just like with proj_ctrl)

	_ Add project, task and subtask deletion capabilities
	_ Finally add pomodoro technique!
	_ Add pure HTML time to pomodoro technique
	_ Make my PHP object-oriented
	_ Maybe one day, relate multiple nodes with one adjacency table or something.
		In reality, projects are graphs, not just trees. The same subtask may appear on multiple nodes.
		To model this condition, a new table could be created, where multiple subtasks are related to eachother.
		This way, completing one subtask will automatically complete many.
		Many meta-tasks may depend upon the same subtask. A copy of the subtask could be selected to appear on many metas.
