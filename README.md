# LAMP app for Pomodoro technique / Getting Things Done

This is a pomodoro technique assistant build with vanilla PHP and HTML. It's intended to run on a basic LAMP server. It doesn't use frameworks or JavaScript.

This project is for instructional purposes only! It has not been secured or thoroughly tested.

## Getting Started

You will have to [set up LAMP](https://medium.com/better-programming/how-to-install-lamp-stack-on-ubuntu-db77ac018116), either on a virtual machine, or on a real server.

### Installing

Simply copy the HTML and PHP files to the server's public_html folder and run [db.sql](https://github.com/voscarmv/pomodori/blob/master/db.sql) on the database.

## Usage

Log in from [index.html](https://github.com/voscarmv/pomodori/blob/master/index.html) and play around with the interface (it should be pretty self-explanatory, if not, feel free to contact me).

The idea is to create a nested structure of pending tasks, and then start working on them in order to complete them.

For example: one task may require you to finish three other subtasks first. On the interface, you're able to create this task structure, and then start working on each task using a pomodoro timer provided with the code.

The app allows you to keep notes for each pomodoro as you work on it. You can then consult these notes to keep track of your progress.
