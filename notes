	PHP sessions are notoriously insecure.
	One need only copy the PHP session ID to gain access to the user account information.
	Some solutions for this problem are suggested.
	The only "failsafe" solution seems to be asking for login/password info on every page.
	But this is not practical.
	Even SSL has had it's quirks.
	IP identification is impractical if the user's behind a proxy or firewall.
	There are three scenarios which I consider the riskiest:
		- Attacker eavesdropping on http packets
		- Attacker gains physical access to user terminal
		- Attacker guesses session id

	Standard db connection should be something like:
		1. Try to connect. Check for db conecction error.
		2. If none, then proceed to attempt queries.
		3. If query fails, exit gracefully. Otherwise, continue.
	If within session, then check for session before connecting to databese, and only attempt db connect if successful session.

	Use tables inside tables to illustrate task/subtask hierarchy.
		<table><tr><td>
			Task
			<table><tr><td>
				Subtask
			</td></td></table>
			<table><tr><td>
				Subtask 2

	Check if lock tables is actually needed in new_subtask.php. Maybe it's not needed, because a single user can only add
	a single subtask at a time (at least hypothetically).
	I would have to split the table on a per-user basis, or somehow prevent the same user from logging into the same
	account on two or more different computers, in able to avoid database collisions.
	Or somehow redesign the database to tolerate such collisions. Who knows?
	I think it would be easier to just guarantee that only a single use will be able to use the deptree table at
	any given time.
