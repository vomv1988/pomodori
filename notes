	Play on words "tomato". Au"tomato", pomodoro = tomato in italian.

	Use meta tag for pure HTML pomodoro countdown:
	<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="5; url=http://example.com/">
	and maybe use animated countdown.gif

	PHP sessions are notoriously insecure.
	One need only copy the PHP session ID to gain access to the user account information.
	Some solutions for this problem are suggested.
	The only "failsafe" solution seems to be asking for login/password info on every page.
	But this is not practical.
	Even SSL has had it's quirks.
	IP identification is impractical if the user's behind a proxy or firewall.
	There are three scenarios which I consider the riskiest:
		- Attacker eavesdropping on http packets
		- Attacker gains physical access to user terminal
		- Attacker guesses session id
	Some solutions:

	Standard db connection should be something like:
		1. Try to connect. Check for db conecction error.
		2. If none, then proceed to attempt queries.
		3. If query fails, exit gracefully. Otherwise, continue.
	If within session, then check for session before connecting to databese, and only attempt db connect if successful session.

	Use tables inside tables to illustrate task/subtask hierarchy.

			</td></td></table>

	Check if lock tables is actually needed in new_subtask.php. Maybe it's not needed, because a single user can only add
	a single subtask at a time (at least hypothetically).
	I would have to split the table on a per-user basis, or somehow prevent the same user from logging into the same
	account on two or more different computers, in able to avoid database collisions.
	Or somehow redesign the database to tolerate such collisions. Who knows?
	I think it would be easier to just guarantee that only a single use will be able to use the deptree table at
	any given time.

	The pomodoro section shall contain a textbox and a timer... to start.

	To delete a project, all tasks and subtasks for the project must be deleted.
	To delete a task, all subtasks and their corresponding pomodori must be deleted.
	To delete a pomodoro, just the pomodoro has to be deleted.
	I should start by deleting pomodori, then tasks/subtasks, then projects.
	I'm thinking deleting tasks may prove the hardest, perhaps use a trigger so that when a task is deleted, all
	it's pomodory go down with it as well.
	Or maybe it would be best to write a query to generalize task/pomodoro deletion.
	Deleting a single task may generate collateral deletions. To find the subtasks belonging to a task, something like
	"between lft and rgt" will be used. That should take care of the tasks, but I need a way to find all pomodori
	belonging to those tasks "between lft and rgt". That is: a way to iterate along all the ixes and subixes
	of the tasks "between lft and rgt".

	Consider the following mysql queries:
		select * from projects inner join deptree inner join pomodoro where projects.username=deptree.username and projects.username='2' and projects.ix=deptree.ix and pomodoro.ix= ...;
		DELETE FROM employees, offices 
                USING employees, offices 
                WHERE employees.officeCode = offices.officeCode  AND 
                offices.officeCode = 1

	Entry deletion done. Still TODO:
		- Mark tasks as pending / done
			If pending, allow marking as done. If done, allow marking as pending.
		- Delete account.
	After that, maybe improve pure HTML design a little.
	Include pure HTML timer.
	THEN:
	Start general improvement:
		- Improve security
			Consider downloading secure session handling pre-written library
		- Implement design pattern
			Read PHP design patterns book
			Read object oriented PHP book
			Implement techniques taught there

	Note that debian handles session timeout through
		/etc/cron.d/php5
		09,39 *     * * *     root   [ -x /usr/lib/php5/sessionclean ] && /usr/lib/php5/sessionclean
	I tried to do an hour-long pomodoro like this. But my session expired before I could push the "Finish" button.
	It would seem that ini_set('session.gc_maxlifetime', 3600); won't work here, because /usr/lib/php5/sessionclean reads
	gc_maxlifetime directly from /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini
	So I'll have to either cancel the cron job by commenting it out from /etc/cron.d/php5 or change php.ini to extend
	gc_maxlifetime

	The site now works as intended. This is the best it's gonna get with only HTML and PHP. From here on, I can only
	improve on it through CSS/JavaScript, etc.

	Perhaps one last thing to do would be to add PHP substitution for those DAMNED single quotes. But from there on, I
	will be DEFILING my work with the OBSCENITIES of CSS and JS. DAMN YOU CSS! DAMN YOU TO HELL!

	As I was saying: up to this point, I have avoided the following things:
		- Style (CSS)
		- Dynamic content (JS)
		- Security (string sanitizing/parsing)
	To date, the project is "pure".
		Time to start defiling...
			Time to start using those new trendy things kids today consider "groovy".
