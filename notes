	PHP sessions are notoriously insecure.
	One need only copy the PHP session ID to gain access to the user account information.
	Some solutions for this problem are suggested.
	The only "failsafe" solution seems to be asking for login/password info on every page.
	But this is not practical.
	Even SSL has had it's quirks.
	IP identification is impractical it the user's behind a proxy or firewall.
	There are three scenarios which I consider the riskiest:
		- Attacker eavesdropping on http packets
		- Attacker gains physical access to user terminal
		- Attacker guesses session id
